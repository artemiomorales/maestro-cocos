Maestro Story Engine for Cocos
End User License Agreement

Licensor: Artemio Morales / ra.morales244@gmail.com

**********************************************/


Overview

  The Maestro Story Engine for Cocos (“Maestro”) is a software extension for the Cocos Creator game engine created by Artemio Morales (“Licensor”) in connection with Artmayu Studios. By downloading, installing or using Maestro in any way, you (“End User”) represent and affirm that you have read, understand and agree to be legally bound by and comply with this End User License Agreement (“Agreement”). If you do not agree with this End User License Agreement, you are not authorized to use Maestro in any manner.


ELIGIBILITY

  Maestro is distributed under two tiers: Maestro Personal and Maestro Commercial. Each tier has a Financial Threshold. To use Maestro, you and everyone using the software on your behalf must be eligible for the tier you are using — this means that your Total Finances cannot exceed that tier’s Financial Threshold.

  Eligibility is determined using the most recent twelve (12) month period. If you are in the middle of a project, and your Total Finances grow beyond the Financial Threshold of your current tier, you can upgrade your license by contacting the Licensor. The manner of measuring your Total Finances varies based on your use case and who you are. Financial Thresholds are shown in US currency and your Total Finances shall be converted to US currency to determine eligibility.

  Total Finances shall be measured as follows:

    If you are a legal entity using Maestro (other than using it to service someone else), your Total Finances are your gross revenues and/or funding

    If you are an individual or a legal entity providing services to a third party, your Total Finances are comprised of your customer or client’s Total Finances

    If you are an individual using Maestro, but not providing services to a third party, your Total Finances are the amount generated in connection with your use of Maestro. In this scenario, your Total Finances would not include amounts you generate from other work (for example, if your day job is as a horticulturalist).

    By using Maestro, you represent and warrant that you are eligible for the tier of Maestro you are using and tiers being used on your behalf. You understand that it is your responsibility to maintain full records establishing your eligibility and you bear the burden of proving your eligibility if we ask.

  Financial Thresholds:

    The Financial Threshold for Maestro Personal is US $100,000 for the most recent twelve (12) month period. To be eligible to use Maestro Personal, your Total Finances may not exceed US $100,000. If your Total Finances exceed US $100,000 you may not use Maestro Personal at all, even for internal projects or prototyping. 

    There is no Financial Threshold for Maestro Commercial. You do not need to qualify to use Maestro Commercial; Maestro Commercial may be used by anyone who purchases the applicable software package.

  No Mixing
  
    Maestro tiers with different Financial Thresholds may not be used at the same time by one entity or individual or for or on behalf of one entity or individual. You must upgrade all licenses if your Total Finances exceed a Financial Threshold.

    If you are using Maestro Commercial and want to provide services to a customer or client who is eligible to use Maestro Personal, you may do so.


1. End User's Rights and Obligations.

  a. Licensor hereby grants to the End User a non-exclusive, non-transferable, worldwide, and perpetual license to Maestro solely:

    (i) to incorporate Maestro, together with substantial, original content, into an electronic application or digital media that has a purpose, features, and functions beyond the display, performance, distribution, or use of Maestro (“Licensed Work”) as an embedded component of that Licensed Work; 

    (ii) to reproduce, publicly display, publicly perform, transmit, and distribute Maestro as incorporated and embedded in that Licensed Work;

  c. End User is granted a single seat license to install and use Maestro only on a maximum of 2 computers. Maestro is licensed on a per seat basis and may not be shared or used concurrently on more than 2 different computers.

However, any Contractor working on a project for an End User must have license(s) to its own license to use Maestro, and, conversely, to use an Asset under SECTIONS (1a) and (1c), a person must have its own license to the Asset, regardless of whether a Contractor working on a project for that person had its own license to that Asset. For example, a person who is a Contractor must have a seat license for Maestro, and the person who is hired by the Contractor must have a seat license for Maestro.
